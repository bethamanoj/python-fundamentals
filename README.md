# Python Basic Programs
This repository contains simple Python programs created during my final year to strengthen programming fundamentals and logical thinking.
## Topics Included
* Basic syntax and operations
* Number-based programs (Prime, Armstrong, Fibonacci, LCM, etc.)
* String manipulation programs
* Sequences and logical problems
## Purpose
To build strong coding fundamentals, practice problem solving, and prepare for software development roles.

More mini-projects and real-world applications will be added soon.
